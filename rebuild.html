        <h3>From today's featured articles</h3>
        <p>OFinal Fantasy Type 0 is a Japanese video game produced by Square Enix in 2011 for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). It is an action role-playing game where players take the role of Class Zero, a group of fourteen students skilled in magic who are recruited by their superiors into a war between the four nations of Orience. The players also engage in large-scale strategy based battles on the world map, and have access to a multiplayer option during story missions and side quests. Developed by the same staff as Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, Type 0 was designed as a departure from the traditions of the Final Fantasy series with its action-based gameplay and dark storyline. It was originally planned for both PSP and mobile, but the mobile version was cancelled in 2008. The game met with commercial success in Japan, and favorable reviews both in Japan and overseas. Plans for international versions were halted due to the flagging PSP market in the Western world. The first non-Japanese version of Type-0 was a fan translation into English in 2014. A high-definition remaster was released worldwide in 2015. <a href="#">(Full article...)</a>

        <h2>Food</h2>
        <p>The cuisine of Hawaii incorporates five distinct styles of food reflecting the diverse food history of settlement and immigration in the Hawaiian Islands. In the pre contact period of Ancient Hawaii (300 AD 1778), Polynesian voyagers brought plants and animals to the Islands. As Native Hawaiians settled the area, they fished, raised taro for poi, planted coconuts, sugarcane, sweet potatoes and yams, and cooked meat and fish in earth ovens.

            <p>Laulau is a Native Hawaiian cuisine dish. The traditional preparation consisted of pork in wrapped taro leaf. In old Hawaii laulau was assembled by taking a few luau leaves and placing a few pieces of fish and pork in the center.

        <p>Hawaiian beer is represented by the largest brewpub in the state, Kona Brewing Company. From 1901 to 1998, "Primo" was one of the most popular Hawaiian beers, and as of 2008, has returned to production, though it is now brewed in California.
